=begin
The following array contains three names and numbers. Group each name with the 
number following it by placing the pair in their own array. Then create a nested 
array containing all three groups. What does this look like? (You don't need to
write any code here. Just alter the value shown so it meets the exercise 
requirements.)

['Dave', 7, 'Miranda', 3, 'Jason', 11]

=end

group_1 = ['Dave', 7]
group_2 = ['Miranda', 3]
group_3 = ['Jason', 11]

all = [group_1, group_2, group_3]
